# Graphizdot-Flowchart-Template
* Graphiz dot is one of the bad documentation written in the history. Try read [here](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html).
* This project is happened during the time when I want to create a flowhcart by using Python, for fun. (even I can use excalidraw.com instead!)
* Flowchart template written using graphviz.dot. 
* Feel free to use!
